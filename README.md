# Website for the Seniors Handicap Invitational Tournament in DFW (SHIFTID)
## An [IGBO](http://www.igbo.org)-affiliated tournament

It's built as a static website using the [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) framework and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This will be fleshed out once the website is deployed.

## Info we need

- Logo / branding
- High-level overview
- Link to registration
- Schedule
- Bowling House
- Map
- Dallas (info about the city, for visitors)
- Rules
- Contacts
- Interesting / Useful links (other IGBO tournaments, local leagues)

## Strategy

- Put it all on a single page, except for the rules and Dallas details, which shall live on their own
- Have a nav bar for each section
    - Clicking a nav item scrolls you to that item
